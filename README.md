# Absolute Affect Reconstruction Theory (AART)

AART is a personal conceptual framework exploring emotional dynamics,
affective collapse, and recovery processes through abstract modeling.

This repository documents an **individual research and thought experiment**.
It is not intended as an academic contribution, clinical reference,
or prescriptive framework.

## Scope
- Conceptual modeling of affective states
- Philosophical and structural exploration
- Speculative relevance to artificial affect systems

## Limitations
- Derived from subjective, first-person experience
- No empirical or statistical validation
- No claim of universality or general applicability

Readers are encouraged to treat this material as exploratory
and context-dependent.

## Intent
The purpose of this repository is **documentation and reflection**,
not persuasion, instruction, or consensus-building.
