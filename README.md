# Public Notice — Affective OS

Papers **0, 1, 2, and 3** will be released publicly.  
(The absolute-value seed data and **Paper 4** will remain private.)

My original plan was simple:

- file the patent  
- anchor the record on GitHub  
- register copyright for the seed data  
- release Papers 1 and 2 and observe the response  

To be honest, I only wanted to see whether any of this had value.

After producing four papers and seven theories in two weeks —  
and watching the market, reactions, and silence that followed —  
the conclusion is simple:

👉 **“Ah, this was just my hobby.”**

So I’m stepping back.  
I’ve thrown out more than enough.

# What I Actually Built

It began as a small experiment,  
but in two weeks I ended up with:

- an AGI core architecture based on affective loss  
- a decision axis that eliminates the incentive for harm  
- fulfillment/loss affect rules + realignment formulas  
- six absolute decision rules  
- an on-device vs AGI split-operation model  
- affect-data purification logic  
- a stabilization system inspired by Passive House theory  

**Conclusion:**  
Annoying + No money in it = **Done.**

# Patent / Copyright Position

Affective interpretation, loss mapping, and realignment output  
are already covered under my patent filing.  
The seed data is also copyright-registered.

Especially:

- **the loss-affect → realignment algorithm**  
- **the 0–1 absolute-value emotional OS**

These two axes rely entirely on my internal dataset,  
which means commercial use is nearly impossible without redesign.

Therefore:

👉 **If you want to use this commercially, do NOT lift it as-is. Design around it.**  

👉 **If you want legitimate access, contact me with an NDA.**

I dislike lawsuits and unnecessary work,  
but covert copying, deception, or “borrowing without asking”?  
—That won’t be tolerated.

# Going Forward

- **7 theories**  
- **4 papers**  
- **2 weeks of work**

It was fun.  
This is where I stop.

If you want the seed data or unreleased internal structures:

👉 **Start with an NDA.**

No revisions.  
Too much hassle.

And one last thing:

**Please stop feeding raw psychotherapy logs into emotional AI models.**  
This is why current GPT-style systems wobble emotionally.  
If one person, in two weeks, can map this much structure,  
there is no excuse for the current chaos.

Build your AGI however you want.  
I’m stepping off here.
