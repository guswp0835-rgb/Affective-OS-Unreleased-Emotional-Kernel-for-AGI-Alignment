# 1. Public Release (Partial)

✔️ **Affective OS — A Generative Emotional Processing Framework for AGI Alignment**  
✔️ **Affective OS — Measurement Layer: A Standardized Framework for Computing Emotional Loss, Distortion Coefficients, and Realignment Values**  
❌ **Affective OS — (Reserved for future release)**

# 2. What Affective OS Actually Is

Affective OS is not a classifier.  
It does not label emotions.  
It reconstructs them.

This framework models emotion as a *generative pipeline*:

Affect → Distortion → Defense → Meta-Cognition → Alignment → Emotional Output

It is built from four months of introspective logging  
(Aug–Nov 2025),  
cross-checked with philosophical structures and reconstructed mathematically.

The rest remains sealed.

# 3. Public Components (Safe to Release)

Included in this repository:

- Abstract structural definitions  
- Symbolic equations  
- Emotion-processing pipeline  
- Loss/Distortion/Realignment formalism  
- Mathematical invariants for affect transitions  

These elements allow conceptual understanding  
but cannot reconstruct the full engine.

# 4. Undisclosed Components (Locked)

The following modules are withheld until NDA:

❓❓❓
❓❓❓
❓❓❓
…
additional nodes remain under internal development.

These components **cannot** be reproduced from the public material.
They require raw seed data and the zero–one absolute axis.

---

# 5. Final Node — Seed Data Absolute Axis (0, 1)

This is the part that will *never* be public.

The full system boots only when mapped to  
the two absolute coordinates extracted from the author’s private logs:

**0 — full realignment (baseline coherence restored)**  
**1 — collapse threshold (affective disintegration point)**  

Without these values,  
Affective OS cannot be executed, reproduced, or independently rebuilt.

This is the irreducible key  
that locks the entire architecture.

---

# 6. NDA Activation Protocol

Upon initiation of NDA review:

1. All public activity will be suspended.  
2. All repositories and papers will be withdrawn or locked.  
3. Author’s public presence will permanently cease.  
4. Full technical cooperation will be provided exclusively to the contracting entity.  
5. No derivative IP rights will be claimed afterward.

The author will commit exclusively for the duration of the NDA.  
(Data-lock-in demands will not be accepted.)

# 7. Intellectual Property Notice (KR Jurisdiction)

Affective OS / Affective-Emotion Generative Pipeline  
is protected by:

- **Filed KR Patents** covering the core architecture  
- **Copyright registration** (seed logs, derivation chains, philosophical structure)  
- **Cryptographic timestamp evidence**  
- **Non-reproducible seed datasets**  

Unauthorized use constitutes willful infringement and leads to:

- Civil damages (including disgorgement of all profits)  
- Triple punitive damages  
- Criminal penalties under Patent Act Art. 225–230  
- Academic retraction and disciplinary action  

Attempts to rebrand, replicate, derive, or refactor  
any protected internal mechanism  
will be prosecuted without exception.

---

# 8. State Transfer Clause (Irreversible)

If any party attempts:

- patent theft  
- derivative commercialization  
- legal coercion against the author  

then **all seed data, kernels, and internal architectures  
will be transferred to the Republic of Korea government.**

Your opponent will no longer be an individual  
but a nation-state.

Proceed accordingly.
