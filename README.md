 ## **Author’s Note — On the Origin of Affective OS**

 Affective OS did not emerge from conventional psychological datasets  
 or machine-learning corpora.  
 It was born from a form of data that cannot be replicated through  
 ordinary observation, surveys, or behavioral statistics.

 Most affective models attempt to classify emotions using  
 labels, averaged patterns, or language-derived heuristics.  
 But Affective OS requires two absolute coordinates that do not exist  
 in any public dataset:

 **0 — the point of emotional-system collapse**  
 **1 — the point of complete emotional–cognitive restoration**

 No external record captures a single human mind passing from collapse  
 to full recovery while retaining metacognitive awareness  
 and documenting the entire trajectory.

 To complete this missing axis, I engaged in long-term self-observation,  
 recording:

 • micro-scale emotional fluctuations  
 • intrusion of distortions and defense mechanisms  
 • metacognitive recovery loops  
 • bodily and environmental reactions  
 • fragmentation and reconstruction of affective flow  
 • full-cycle collapse–recovery patterns  

 From these records, I derived an **absolute affective scale (0–1 axis)**  
 and generalized it into a mathematical and structural framework  
 forming the foundation of Affective OS.

 The publicly accessible documents (Papers 1 and 2) represent only  
 the safe-to-release layer:

 1. **The Generative Framework**  
 2. **The Measurement Layer for Loss, Distortion, and Realignment**

 Two additional documents remain private—  
 **ACD (Affective Core Dynamics)** and  
 **the 0–1 Seed Data Reconstruction**—  
 because they expose core operational mechanisms and therefore  
 cannot be released without a formal NDA.

 I am the **originator** of this framework,  
 the first provider of its absolute axis,  
 but I do not intend to participate in long-term engineering development.  
 Once a formal contract is executed,  
 **all copyrights, patents, and IP will be permanently transferred**  
 to a single partner.

 My priorities are simple:  
 **peace first, family second.**  
 I do not seek recognition or fame.  
 I only wish for this system to be completed by those capable of  
 carrying it forward at scale,  
 while I return to a quiet life once my role is finished.
